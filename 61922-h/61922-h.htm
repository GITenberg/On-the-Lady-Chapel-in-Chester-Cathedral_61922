<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Lady Chapel of the Cathedral of
Chester has long been known to antiquarian architects as an
interesting and valuable specimen of the Early English style, but
it has scarcely ever been examined in detail by them, and to the
general observer has presented no features of special
interest.&nbsp; The keen and accurate judgment of Rickman
discovered the general beauty of its proportions; but the
destruction of all the original windows, and other disfigurements
of the building, which took place when the side aisles were added
in the 15th century, have served so far to obscure its beauties,
that it has been supposed to possess little or nothing worthy of
observation.</p>

<p>It is now undergoing restoration, as far as circumstances
admit of it; and the chromatic decoration of the interior has
been entrusted to the care of Mr. Octavius Hudson, whose works at
Salisbury and elsewhere have established him as an artist of the
first rank in this special department.&nbsp; The beauty and high
finish of his work have attracted general admiration, and
awakened a new interest in the structure and composition of the
Lady Chapel itself.&nbsp; On this account I am induced to think
that some remarks upon the history of Lady Chapels in general,
and of our own in particular, will not be inappropriate to the
purposes of the Chester Arch&aelig;ological Society.</p>
<p>I think it fair to state in my own defence, if the information
which I am able to give shall appear to be meagre and imperfect,
that, when I entered upon the subject I had hoped to meet with
some materials elucidating the origin, uses, and characteristics
of Lady Chapels, which I have failed to discover.&nbsp; I have
not been able to find that the subject has been specially
investigated, or that the history of Lady Chapels, as separate
from that of Cathedrals, has ever been traced up to its <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>source.&nbsp; I
believe it to be a yet unexplored mine of antiquarian lore, and
one well worthy of the labour of the ecclesiastical
arch&aelig;ologist.&nbsp; But, for myself, having neither leisure
nor opportunity to explore it thoroughly, I must be content to
give such few and simple elements of the history as I have been
able to glean out of the few books within reach.</p>
<p>It is well known that all the European nations, from the
earliest introduction of Christianity among them, have directed
their most solemn worship towards the East,&mdash;a custom which
we may clearly trace to the course which the progress of the
Gospel took in its advance through Europe, arising from the East,
and going on still towards the West, and thus realizing to each
nation the Scriptural promise of the &ldquo;rising of the Sun of
Righteousness with healing on his wings.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hope,
also, of the re-appearing of the Saviour has always been directed
towards the East; and as that hope was of a very vivid and
energetic character in the earlier times of the Church, it gave
further strength to the habit of addressing their devoutest
aspirations in that direction.&nbsp; As soon as the
acknowledgment of Christianity by the Empire admitted of the
erection of public buildings for the celebration of divine
worship, the system of Orientation was introduced into
them.&nbsp; The altar was placed in or near the eastern extremity
of every church: all the higher ceremonies of religion, and
especially the administration of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, were
celebrated there; and thither the eyes and thoughts of the
congregation were directed as to the place of sacredness and
honour.&nbsp; For a long period the eastern part of the churches
was especially held sacred to the name and honour of Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; But when the worship of the Virgin Mary began to
assume the prominence which it has ever since held in the Romish
Church, and to eclipse that of our Lord himself, it was usually
celebrated in the eastern portion of the church; and, as if to
give to it more special honour, the recess or chapel at the
eastern extremity, adopted from the holy place of the Temple at
Jerusalem, was appropriated to it.&nbsp; And a still further
eastern end was frequently thrown out from the original
structure, where the worship of the Virgin might be specially
celebrated; where her statues, and shrines, and offerings might
be placed; and to which not only the gaze of the people in the
choir, but of the officiating priest himself as he stood before
the high altar, might be constantly directed.&nbsp; Thus,
according to the quaint remark of Fuller, a gradation of
reverence was established&mdash;&ldquo;The porch said to the
church-yard, and the church said to the porch, and the chancel
said to the church, and the Lady Chapel said to them all:
&lsquo;Stand further off, I am holier than
thou.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It sometimes, indeed, happened in particular Cathedrals or
churches that there was a Saint connected with the place who was
locally held <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>in higher honour, on account of the miraculous powers
attributed to his or her relics, than even the Virgin Mary, and
in such cases the eastern chapel was devoted to the honour of
that Saint: as that of Becket, at Canterbury; St. Cuthbert, at
Durham; St. Ethelreda, at Ely; St. Alban, at St. Albans; and St.
Edward, at Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; In such cases we find the
Lady Chapel placed elsewhere, as at Canterbury in the north aisle
of the nave; at Durham, at the west end, where it is called the
Galilee; at Rochester, in the south transept; at Oxford and
Bristol, on the north side of the choir.&nbsp; In all the other
Cathedrals the Lady Chapel is at the eastern extremity.</p>
<p>In the Cathedral of Chester it is most probable that the
eastern extremity of the <i>Norman</i> choir was occupied by the
chapel and shrine <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> of St. Werburgh, reaching as far as the
eastern arch of the present choir; and, if so, the chapel of the
Virgin would be at the extremity of the south aisle of the
choir.&nbsp; Although the present building is far more extensive
than that of Norman times, we shall probably find the same
principles of structure and arrangement still adhered to.&nbsp;
We have a niche still remaining, indicating the existence of an
image of the Virgin, and a piscina, implying an altar, at the
eastern termination of this aisle; and these are probably the
vestiges of an earlier arrangement which had appropriated that
part of the building to the worship of the Virgin, and they were
merely repeated on the new and enlarged choir, though the altar
of the Virgin was then removed to a more honourable place.</p>
<p>At the date of the erection of the present Lady Chapel, which
I shall endeavour to fix about <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
1280, St. Werburgh had begun to decline somewhat in popular
estimation; no miracles were ever performed at her shrine, and
the taste of the age was for some demonstration of the power of
the saints.&nbsp; There happened also to be a burst of devotion
at that period towards the Virgin Mary.&nbsp; And therefore, when
the Norman Chapel of St. Werburgh was pulled down, and the choir
extended, it was natural that a new and more sumptuous chapel
should be given to the honour of the Virgin, occupying the same
relative position, at the eastern extremity of the choir.&nbsp;
The original position of the shrine of St. Werburgh was probably
preserved under this new arrangement; but instead of being in a
separate chapel to the east of the Choir, it now <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>fell within the
Choir, which was lengthened so as to include it.&nbsp; In this
position it is believed to have remained until the period of the
Reformation, when the stone structure containing the shrine was
removed and converted into a throne for the Bishop.&nbsp; Thus,
without doing disrespect to the patron saint of the Church, the
Virgin Mary was honoured with a new Chapel, to which special care
and large expenditure of means were devoted.</p>
<p>The history of Lady Chapels, as they are found appended to all
the larger Churches of Europe, and forming a part of the interior
arrangement of the smaller ones, can hardly be investigated
without some reference to the rise and progress of the Mariolatry
of the Church of Rome.&nbsp; Such reference would hardly fall
within the range of subjects usually treated of by this Society,
and would lead us off into questions of theology and
ecclesiastical history far too extensive to be dealt with in a
brief and popular lecture.&nbsp; I shall therefore content myself
with observing that the exaltation of the Virgin Mary as an
object of worship took its rise in the fifth century, and
advanced by gradual stages of growth until we find in the
eleventh century, about the date of the Conquest, that a daily
office was instituted in her honour, divine titles began to be
ascribed to her, and every imaginable epithet, expressive of
adoration and extravagant superstition, was lavished upon her in
the writings of the time.&nbsp; It was at this period, just when
the first Norman Earl re-founded the Monastery of St. Werburgh,
and erected the building of which so many portions still remain,
that Lady Chapels began to be added to churches in this
kingdom.&nbsp; The worship of the Virgin, which had then assumed
a very prominent and elaborate character, required a separate
place for the celebration of it.&nbsp; And it is not
uninteresting to remember that Anselm, Abbot of Bec and
Archbishop of Canterbury, whom Hugh Lupus brought to Chester in
order that he might re-model the conventual establishment, was a
devoted worshipper of the Virgin Mary, and introduced into
England a festival in honour of the Immaculate Conception.&nbsp;
He would take care, therefore, that all honour was done to her,
and all due provision made for the celebration of her worship in
the new conventual church.&nbsp; We have no exact plan of that
Norman structure, but from the vestiges of it which were
discovered in 1841, it was apparent that there was an eastern
apse or chapel, extending beyond the choir itself, which was
intended probably as the chapel of the Virgin, though, as we have
suggested, used as a site for the shrine of St. Werburgh.&nbsp;
All this structure disappeared at the end of the 13th century, to
make way for the present buildings, and just at this period the
enthusiasm on the subject of the honour due to the Blessed Virgin
was at its height.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>We will
endeavour now to fix, as nearly as we can, the date of the
present Lady Chapel.&nbsp; Upon comparing it with the Chapter
House the earliest of our buildings of the Early English period,
a marked difference appears in the composition of the mouldings,
the form of the window jambs, the size and character of the
bosses, bespeaking for the Lady Chapel a more advanced period of
the style.&nbsp; We find here, externally, ponderous upright
buttresses, chamfered at the angles, and with indications of
clustered columns on those of the eastern part of the
building.&nbsp; A rich and deep hollow cornice, with very large
and massive single dog-tooth ornaments, placed above a foot
apart, over-hangs the outer wall, but it is now concealed under
the roof of the side aisles.&nbsp; We have, internally,
multiplied round-and-hollow mouldings around the windows,
interspersed with the dog-tooth mouldings; bold and massive ribs
in the groined roof, with very rich and highly-wrought bosses of
great size at the intersections of the main ribs.&nbsp; These
indications of an advanced style lead us to fix the date of
erection at the period of transition from the Early English to
the Decorated Order, or about the close of the 13th
century.&nbsp; This would bring us to the time when Simon de Albo
Monasterio was Abbot of St. Werburgh.&nbsp; He was the most able
of the Abbots of Chester, and the most magnificent in his
architectural restorations.&nbsp; His accession to the Abbacy is
dated as <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1265, and he lived
until 1289, in the reigns of Henry III. and Edward I.&nbsp; In
the 12th year of Edward I. we have a record of a precept being
granted to allow venison from the King&rsquo;s forests of
Delamere and Wirral, for the support of the Monks of St. Werburgh
who were engaged in the building of their church.&nbsp; It is
clear that the first building on which they were then engaged was
the present Lady Chapel, which bears evidence of the desire of
the Abbot to make it worthy of her to whom it was dedicated, and
of his own character for munificence.&nbsp; It is not improbable
that this Chapel was all that was finished during the life-time
of this Abbot, for there is an evident decline of architectural
effort and means in the eastern portion of the choir, which was
erected immediately after the Chapel.&nbsp; The great arch which
unites the choir with the Chapel is remarked upon by Rickman, for
the richness of its multiplied rounds and hollows, but this
richness is not carried on to the westward.&nbsp; I may here
remark, by the way, that this arch seems to have been formed out
of the old Norman east window of the original Lady Chapel, as
there are plain indications of Norman structure in the wall on
each side of it.&nbsp; We venture then to fix the date of the
erection at about 1280.</p>
<p>The Lady Chapel, as built by Simon de Albo Monasterio, was
without aisles; the outer walls being buttressed and corniced as
before described, and with a parapet, of which no portion now
remains.&nbsp; There <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>were three triplet windows on each side, of which the
jamb mouldings only remain.&nbsp; The tracery of four of them was
entirely removed when the side aisles were built, and that of the
other two replaced at the same period by coarse perpendicular
tracery.&nbsp; The eastern window was probably of five
lights.&nbsp; Traces of its mullions yet remain, running down on
the external face of the eastern end.&nbsp; Sufficient vestiges
of the composition of the exterior of the Chapel yet remain to
admit of its being restored externally, as well as internally, to
its original form.</p>
<p>It does not appear that there was any entrance to the Chapel,
as it was first built, except through the eastern arch from the
choir.&nbsp; We enter it now through the side aisles, one of the
windows having been cut away on each side, down to the base of
the wall, in order to open this passage.&nbsp; This was probably
done at the same time that the high altar was erected in the
choir and elevated upon a platform so lofty as wholly to obstruct
the passage under the eastern arch.&nbsp; This platform, which
buried the columns up to four feet above the base mouldings, was
considerably lowered in 1841.</p>
<p>When we enter the Chapel, the first thing perhaps that strikes
us is the lowness of the ceiling, being only 32 feet from the
floor to the central rib, for it is one characteristic of the
buildings of this date that they rise far above the height of the
Norman vaulting, and give a great impression of loftiness and
lightness.&nbsp; The causes of this defect, if it be one, in this
building, seem to have been two:&mdash;In the first place, it was
necessary to keep the roof at such an elevation as would not
interfere with the light of the upper east window of the
choir.&nbsp; In the second place, the floor of the Chapel has
been raised above its original level, as will be apparent from
the line of the stone bench which runs round the exterior; and
from the position of the Sedilia at the east end.&nbsp; Of the
eastern window, as well of the two which are near it, on the
north and south, it is obvious to remark that the tracery is of a
late Perpendicular character, while the jamb mouldings are of
late Decorated.&nbsp; Thence arises one of the chief defects of
the interior of the Chapel,&mdash;the want of harmony in its
architectural details, striking the eye most forcibly in the east
window, the plain perpendicular tracery of which is so manifestly
incongruous with the pointed English character of the surrounding
features of the building.&nbsp; The liberality of the citizens of
Chester has indeed in some measure diminished the unpleasing
effect of this contrast, by the introduction of a fine east
window of painted glass, designed by Pugin, and executed by
Wailes in his best manner.&nbsp; But it is impossible not to
regret that the tracery itself was not restored to its proper
character before the painted glass was introduced; nor is it
unreasonable to hope that this may yet be done, and that the fine
window of five lights may yet be reconstructed, <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>in order to
complete the restoration of the interior of this beautiful
Chapel.</p>
<p>The next observable feature of the Chapel is the groined roof,
marked especially by its singular and beautiful bosses at the
three principal points of intersection of the ribs.&nbsp; These
bosses are of unusually large size for so low a building, being
of three feet diameter, and descending below the ceiling more
than 18 inches.&nbsp; The weight of each boss is nearly two
tons.&nbsp; They exhibit great care and skill in design and
execution, and are finished with that attention to details which
marks the works of that age, though it appears to be almost a
waste of labour when employed on objects so far above the eye of
the spectator.</p>
<p>The central boss bears a figure of the Virgin and
Child,&mdash;the eastern one, a symbol of the Trinity,&mdash;and
the western one a representation of the murder of Thomas a
Becket.</p>
<p>It is not improbable that these three subjects, placed in this
order from east to west, were designed to embody the three great
features of the Christian Church of that age.&nbsp; We have in
the first a figure of the Father, seated on His throne, holding
between His knees a small crucifix, and the dove rests on the
cross, in the attitude of whispering into the Saviour&rsquo;s
ear.&nbsp; This was not an uncommon form of representing the
Trinity in early times, and forcibly, though rudely, shadows out
the elements of Christian truth,&mdash;the Father, who is in
heaven, holding forth the Son, crucified for us; and the Holy
Spirit concurring in the scheme of redemption, and ministering
comfort to the Saviour to support Him in His last agony. <a
name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a></p>
<p>We have in the second boss the representation of the worship
of the Virgin Mary,&mdash;the prominent characteristic of the
Romish Church.&nbsp; The Virgin is represented, according to
invariable custom, as seated, and with the infant Saviour in her
arms; <i>she</i>, and not the Saviour, being the main subject of
the work.&nbsp; The Saviour was always thus <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>represented,
as an infant in His mother&rsquo;s arms, not only to mark her
identity, but to embody the idea of her influence and authority
over Him and His Church.</p>
<p>We then have in the third boss an indication both of the
worship of the Saints and of the supremacy of the Pope, in the
martyrdom of Thomas a Becket.&nbsp; And thus we have a complete
series of symbolic representations of the doctrine of the Church
of Rome.</p>
<p>This third boss deserves some special attention.&nbsp; It had
long perplexed the judgment of curious observers, and defied the
skill of arch&aelig;ological critics.&nbsp; Being beyond the
reach of minute examination, and the arrangement of the figures
being somewhat involved, it was not easy to interpret it.&nbsp;
It passed with some for the Assumption of the Virgin; with others
for the Resurrection of our Lord, because the figures of armed
men were apparent in it; but no one guessed at the true subject,
until a cast was taken of it and it could be examined upon the
ground.&nbsp; There is no question now as to what it
represents,&mdash;the murder of Thomas a Becket,&mdash;and that
it gives a somewhat unusual version of that event.&nbsp; There
are many representations of the murder&mdash;some almost
contemporary with it&mdash;both in painted glass and in
sculptured stone, especially in France and Italy.&nbsp; Not only
was Becket himself one of the most distinguished and courageous
defenders of the rights and authority of the Romish Church
against regal aggression, but his death formed a great crisis in
the history of the Papal power, and opened the way to a vast
extension of it throughout Europe.&nbsp; On this account the
memory of his martyrdom was perpetuated in every possible
form.&nbsp; But singularly enough, for an event so notorious, and
of which the details were recorded by nearly thirty contemporary
writers, the actual representations of it differ very much from
one another, and from the real facts of the story.&nbsp; In Mr.
Stanley&rsquo;s <i>Memorials of Canterbury Cathedral</i>, a
careful comparison of all the narratives of the martyrdom is
instituted, and an accurate analysis given of the facts which may
be deemed authentic.&nbsp; With these facts our boss agrees more
closely than most other delineations of the same subject.&nbsp;
We have in it, of course, the figures of the four memorable
Knights who were the perpetrators of the deed: Reginald Fitzurse,
Hugh de Morville, William de Tracy, and Richard de Brez.&nbsp;
These are all represented as wearing chain armour, with the usual
steel caps of the Crusaders, and bearing swords and
shields.&nbsp; The figures are curiously interwoven, and turned
backwards upon the stone, in order to bring them all into the
limited space.&nbsp; The shields which they carry have all their
several heraldic devices.&nbsp; This is exactly according to
fact.&nbsp; The figure of Becket is represented, as usual,
kneeling at an altar, with his head bent forward.&nbsp; Beside
him stands the monk Grim, bearing <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the crozier or cross.&nbsp; Fitzurse,
whose identity is marked by the bears on his shield, holds his
sword with both hands, prepared to strike; but it seems to be
Richard de Brez, who bears a boar&rsquo;s head on his shield, who
strikes the blow, and the blow is represented as falling on the
crown of Beckett head, so as to cut off the scalp.&nbsp; This is
precisely in accordance with the best authenticated
narratives.&nbsp; For though the first blow which was struck was
from Tracy, the fatal one was given by Brez or Breton.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The stroke was aimed with such violence,&rdquo; says the
narrative of the monk Grim, &ldquo;that the scalp or crown of the
head&mdash;which it was remarked was of unusual size&mdash;was
severed from the skull, and the sword snapped in two on the
marble pavement.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the final act which is
represented upon the boss,&mdash;the act which completed the
martyrdom and set free the soul of Becket, as it was said, from
its earthly prison, that it might go to receive its glory in
heaven, as one of the chiefest Saints of Christ&rsquo;s Catholic
Church.</p>
<p>It is not uninteresting to trace out a reason for the accurate
delineation of the facts of this murder upon this boss.&nbsp; In
the celebrated translation of the body of the canonized Saint
from the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral, where it had been at
first buried, to the newly-erected Shrine at the east end of the
choir of the same church,&mdash;which translation was made by
Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the presence of
King Henry III. and all the Prelates of the realm, and cost, in
pomp and ceremony, more than a coronation,&mdash;the Bishop of
Chester of that day <a name="citation11a"></a><a
href="#footnote11a" class="citation">[11a]</a> was a principal
actor.&nbsp; He was joined with Langton in the Royal Commission,
which bears date <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1220.&nbsp;
The Bishop would most likely bring back with him from Canterbury
to Chester a vivid impression of the solemnity of the scenes, and
of the virtues of the martyr.&nbsp; He <i>did</i> bring back with
him a very precious relic of the Saint, no less than the girdle
which he wore at the time of his martyrdom.&nbsp; And this girdle
he presented to the Abbey of St. Werburgh, where it was preserved
with religious care until the time when all such relics acquired
perhaps something less than their intrinsic value, and were
destroyed at the Dissolution.&nbsp; With the relic, the Bishop
would be likely to bring with him an accurate version of the
details of the murder, and this version would be embodied on the
sculptured stone of this boss.</p>
<p>I will venture, on taking leave of this subject, to add to my
remarks the more valuable commentary of Mr. Stanley, <a
name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a> which will point the moral of my
tale:&mdash;&ldquo;We must all remember, that the wretched
superstitions <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>which gathered round the Shrine (and name) of Thomas of
Canterbury, ended by completely alienating the affections of
thinking men from his memory, and rendering the name of Becket a
bye-word of reproach, as little proportioned to his real deserts
as had been the reckless veneration paid to it by his worshippers
in the middle ages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pass now from the architectural character of this Lady
Chapel to its history.&nbsp; Would that I could say that any
materials exist from which I might construct a narrative of the
events which have occurred within its walls during the six
centuries of its existence.&nbsp; If we were able to look back
into the dark period of its early history, and discover the
secrets of monastic life which have been transacted here, we
might tell some tales which would interest and astonish hearers
of these more enlightened times.&nbsp; But it is as well,
perhaps, that curiosity cannot be satisfied with the discovery of
facts which we should be very likely to misunderstand and
misjudge.&nbsp; And we must be content to pass the whole period
from the building of the Chapel in or about 1280 to the
dissolution of the Monastery, in 1541, as a blank on which no
light of history or of records, or even of tradition, has been
thrown.&nbsp; The only fact of that period which bears the
slightest interest, is the burial of John de Salghall, one of the
later Abbots, who died in the year 1452, temp. Henry VI.&nbsp;
His burial place is described as being &ldquo;between two pillars
on the south side of the Chapel, under an alabaster stone;&rdquo;
on which we may observe that, as the spot so marked out is in the
opening made by the cutting away the wall under the south window
to gain an opening into the south aisle, that aisle must have
been built previously; and yet it is commonly <i>said</i> to have
been built in the reign of Henry VII. <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a></p>
<p>The stone under which the Abbot was buried still
remains,&mdash;not of alabaster, but Purbeck marble,&mdash;and
bears the traces of a very rich brass, which must have nearly
covered the whole stone.&nbsp; About thirty years ago this stone
was removed, and the Abbot&rsquo;s coffin was found under it, in
a tolerably perfect state.&nbsp; His body was enveloped in folds
of cerecloth; and an illegible writing on parchment lay upon this
breast.&nbsp; His gold ring of office, containing a large
sapphire, was on the forefinger of his right hand.&nbsp; This was
not interred again with the rest of the contents of the coffin,
but is now preserved amongst the treasures of the Chapter.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>I may
observe that, at the period of the Reformation, when the worship
of the Virgin was repudiated by the Church of England, it seems
to have been an object with the Reformers to desecrate all the
Lady Chapels, with a view to extinguish the yet lingering
prejudice in favour of the places where the interest and
intercession of the Blessed Virgin had been sought for during so
many centuries.&nbsp; They were, for the most part, converted to
some secular uses, and employed as schools, or vestries, or
consistorial courts.&nbsp; To this latter use the Lady Chapel of
our Cathedral was appropriated; and there it was that Bishop
Cotes, in the reign of Queen Mary, (<span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1555) held the trial of George Marsh
for heresy, and condemned him to be burned at the stake,&mdash;a
sentence which was shortly afterwards carried into execution at
Boughton on April 24, 1555. <a name="citation13a"></a><a
href="#footnote13a" class="citation">[13a]</a></p>
<p>We know not how soon after this the Consistory Court was
removed from the Lady Chapel to its present position in the
south-western tower, but probably at the period of the
Restoration.&nbsp; From that date the Chapel has been restored to
more befitting uses, and the early Morning Prayers, or Matins,
have been always read there.</p>
<p>In Webb&rsquo;s <i>Itinerary</i>, <a name="citation13b"></a><a
href="#footnote13b" class="citation">[13b]</a> speaking of the
Lady Chapel as it appeared in his day (<span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1640), he says that it was
&ldquo;adorned with a fair window to the east, of very curious
workmanship in glass, where hath been the story of the Blessed
Virgin, her descent from the loins of Jesse, in the line of
David; though now, through injury of time and weather, the same
story is much blemished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forty years after that, the mischief which had been commenced
&ldquo;by time and weather,&rdquo; was completed by a tumultuous
mob of the citizens of Chester, instigated, as it was supposed,
by James Duke of Monmouth, who was at that time in Chester,
courting popularity.&nbsp; They broke into the Cathedral, and
amongst other outrages committed upon the contents of the sacred
building, wholly destroyed the painted glass of the east window
of the Lady Chapel.&nbsp; It has been the work of the citizens in
a later age, and under a better feeling, to repair the injury
done by their forefathers, and once more adorn the east window
with &ldquo;very curious workmanship in glass,&rdquo;&mdash;an
example which has been followed by many private individuals, so
that we have now all the windows of the Chapel so decorated, at a
cost of not less than &pound;1,500.</p>
<p>Permit me to say a few words in conclusion, as to the purpose
and character of the works which are now going on in this
Chapel.&nbsp; I shall not venture to name the person by whose
suggestion they were entered <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>upon, and at whose cost the
decorative part is to be executed, as it is her desire to be kept
in the back ground, and to let all be done to the glory of
God.&nbsp; But I may state that the object is to restore the
interior of the Chapel to the same state in which we may believe
it to have been left by its first builders.&nbsp; From a close
and careful examination of the bosses, ribs, window mouldings,
and capitals, it is apparent that they had received the
decorative colouring usual in buildings of that date; and the
remains of it, found under accumulated coats of whitewash, were
sufficient to indicate precisely the several tones of colour, so
as to enable the artist who examined them to restore exactly the
original design.&nbsp; Mr. Octavius Hudson, who has made this
branch of ancient art his special study, and has shewn his skill
and knowledge of the subject in his admirable chromatic works at
Salisbury, has had the restoration of this Chapel entrusted to
his care.</p>
<p>I believe that there are some persons who look with no little
suspicion upon these attempts to revive the medi&aelig;val
character of our sacred buildings; thinking it to be symptomatic
of Romanizing tendencies; or, at least, likely to foster them;
and apprehending that, if we begin by introducing medi&aelig;val
ornament, we may perhaps end by bringing in medi&aelig;val
ceremonies.</p>
<p>It is quite true that whitewash has long been the symbol of
true Protestantism.&nbsp; Successive coats of it have been laid
over the ancient mural decorations of our Churches, in order, as
it were, to perpetuate the abhorrence of Popish superstition by
washing out the stain of it from the very walls.&nbsp; Everything
that would serve to please the eye, and indulge the sentiment;
everything that even tended to express a desire to glorify the
House of God, and to impress the worshippers in it with
reverential feelings, has been excluded, as if it were
idolatrous.&nbsp; We have all been educated in an atmosphere of
ecclesiastical whitewash.&nbsp; People&rsquo;s eyes have been so
habituated to it, as the one established Church pigment, that
they are with difficulty brought to think anything else orthodox
or appropriate.</p>
<p>But, as to the principle of colouring, as a means of giving a
pleasing and reverent character to the interior of our Churches,
surely we need not confound the idea of simplicity in <i>the
worship</i> of God, with that of plainness in <i>the
building</i>.&nbsp; To the former we are happily restricted, as
well by our established Ritual, as by our common sense of what is
true and edifying.&nbsp; To the latter we are not limited by any
rule, legal or Scriptural.&nbsp; Admitting that when we introduce
fanciful varieties of costume, and gesture, and embellishment
into the offices of Divine worship, we are lowering the spirit
and the meaning of it, it by no means follows that the same
objection applies to the rich and chromatic ornamentation of the
edifice itself.&nbsp; In that we are obviously doing <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>honour to Him
whose name it bears, and shewing a desire to give Him the best we
have.&nbsp; &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s daughter is all glorious
within,&rdquo; may be no less applicable, though in a secondary
sense, to the <i>material</i> than to the <i>spiritual</i> Church
of Christ.&nbsp; All natural products are to be employed
&ldquo;to beautify the place of my sanctuary,&rdquo; under the
Christian dispensation no less than under the Jewish; &ldquo;and
I will make the place of my feet glorious,&rdquo; (Isaiah lx.
13).&nbsp; We do not in these days question the propriety of
reviving the highly elaborate ecclesiastical architecture of the
middle ages, in order to give a rich and grand effect to our
Houses of God.&nbsp; I do not see the difference between doing
that, and enriching them with appropriate colouring, to relieve
the monotony of effect.&nbsp; One is as much calculated as the
other to give a richer and more impressive tone to what presents
itself to the senses of the worshipper.&nbsp; There is no more
symbolism in one than in the other; no more symptom of a return
to medi&aelig;val superstition.</p>
<p>Viewing the question simply in an artistic or
arch&aelig;ological point of view, it may be very well doubted
whether we can form a correct estimate of the real beauty and
effect of medi&aelig;val architecture without restoring the
colouring which originally formed a part of it.&nbsp; <i>We</i>
do not see it as they who built the Churches saw it.&nbsp; If we
trust to them for a correct taste in structural arrangement, why
not trust them also in the point of colour?&nbsp; What would
those medi&aelig;val artists feel, if brought back to see the now
colourless walls and ceilings of their richly ornamented
structures?&nbsp; What would Simon de Albo Monasterio say to the
state of our Lady Chapel?&nbsp; What would Michael Angelo, or any
person of taste, say if he could see the interior of St.
Peter&rsquo;s all covered with whitewash?</p>
<p>Whatever caution may be required in the revival of this
ancient style of decoration,&mdash;and, beyond all question,
great judgment and skill are needed to revive the ancient tone of
colouring, so that it may serve to please the eye without
offending the sense of propriety,&mdash;yet I think the advancing
intelligence and taste of the age will be found to sanction the
attempt.&nbsp; The few experiments which have lately been made in
this art in Ely Cathedral and Salisbury Chapter House, have been
eminently successful, and have brought out effects in the
building unobserved before.&nbsp; It is probable that this will
be also the effect here.&nbsp; And I will venture to add the
expression of a hope that the day will come when the same style
of decoration may he extended, in some measure, to the groined
roof of the Choir.&nbsp; That monotonous mass of wood and plaster
would be awakened into some life and beauty by a few touches of
gold and colour, and it would be relieved from the reproach, now
sometimes cast upon it, of being but a very poor attempt to
represent stone.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>To
revert for a moment to the Lady Chapel.&nbsp; I have already
complained of the incongruous character of the tracery of the
east window as disturbing the harmonious effect of the
interior.&nbsp; A project is now on foot for replacing it by a
five-light Early English window, from a design by Mr.
Scott.&nbsp; It were much to be wished that the benevolence of
individuals, interested in Church restoration, could be applied
to assist the Dean and Chapter in restoring the <i>exterior</i>
of this Chapel.&nbsp; It is now in a dilapidated, if not a
dangerous condition; and as it is the first part of the building
which presents itself to the eye of an observer on the City
Walls, it might be made as rich and pleasing in architectural
effect, as it is now poor and offensive.&nbsp; The spirit of the
citizens and of the county has been once called forth to aid the
work of restoration.&nbsp; May it be again awakened to promote
the honour of Almighty God, by beautifying this place of His
sanctuary! <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"

Cheshire</i>, 4to, 1817, page 221, states that the Shrine of St.
Werburgh, and the pedestal on which it rested, &ldquo;formerly
stood in the Chapel of the Virgin at the east end of the Choir;
and that the pedestal was removed to its present position soon
after the Reformation, and converted into the Episcopal
Throne.&rdquo;&nbsp; History is silent as to the fate of the
Shrine itself; but being of great intrinsic value, it no doubt
vanished at the Dissolution, along with other precious relics
belonging to the Abbey.</p>
<p><a name="footnote9"></a><a href="#citation9"

Trinitarian device occur to us; but it will suffice to instance
the beautiful contemporary seal of the Holy Trinity Priory at
York, the general design of which very much resembles that upon
the Lady Chapel boss, except in the position of the dove, which
in the York seal appears to be in the act of descending from the
Father upon the head of the crucified Saviour.&nbsp; Another and
a later example, of the 16th century, is given in the <i>Journal
of the British Arch&aelig;ological Institute</i>, Vol. VIII., p.
317, from a silver medallion, the work of Heinrich Reitz, of
Leipsic, who flourished from <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
1553&ndash;1586.&nbsp; It ought perhaps to be mentioned, that
this curious boss was for more than two centuries hidden from
view by an immense block of plaster moulded into the form of a
Tudor rose; and that its real character was only discovered by
mere accident, while preparing the groined ceiling for chromatic
treatment, at the hands of Mr. Octavius Hudson.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
